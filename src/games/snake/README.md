# Snake

Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions.

## Game Rules

1. **Basic Gameplay**
   - Control a snake that moves continuously in the game area
   - Eat different types of food to grow longer and earn points:
     * Apple (üçé): Large food (2x2 grid), 50 points
     * Candy (üç¨): Small food (1x1 grid), 150 points
   - Avoid hitting walls and the snake's own body
   - Apples appear more frequently (70% chance)
   - Candies are rarer but worth more points (30% chance)

2. **Controls**
   - **LEFT Arrow** or **A**: Turn snake left
   - **RIGHT Arrow** or **D**: Turn snake right
   - **UP Arrow** or **W**: Turn snake upward
   - **DOWN Arrow** or **S**: Turn snake downward
   - **P/ESC**: Pause game
   - **R**: Restart after game over
   - **ENTER**: Start game (from welcome screen)

3. **Game Elements**
   - **Snake Body (‚ñà‚ñà)**: The snake's body segments
   - **Apple (üçé)**: Large food that takes up 4 squares
   - **Candy (üç¨)**: Small food that takes up 1 square
   - **Game Area (¬∑¬∑)**: Empty spaces where the snake can move

4. **Game Over Conditions**
   - Hitting the walls (game boundaries)
   - Colliding with the snake's own body
   - Your final score will be displayed

## Tips for Playing

1. **Plan Your Route**
   - Think ahead about your path to the food
   - Be extra careful when approaching apples as they take up more space
   - Consider the risk/reward of going for candies vs apples

2. **Strategic Movement**
   - Don't make sudden turns that might cause self-collision
   - Use the game area efficiently
   - Keep track of your snake's length as it grows
