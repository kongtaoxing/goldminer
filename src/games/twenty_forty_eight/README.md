# 2048

2048 is an engaging puzzle game where players combine numbered tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile.

## Game Rules

1. **Basic Gameplay**
   - The game is played on a 4x4 grid
   - Each turn, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears
   - Move tiles in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right)
   - When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with their sum

2. **Controls**
   - **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move all tiles in the chosen direction
   - **P** or **ESC**: Pause/Resume game
   - **R**: Restart after game over

3. **Scoring System**
   - Score increases by the value of each merged tile
   - For example, merging two 8 tiles adds 16 points to your score
   - Try to achieve the highest score possible!

4. **Game Over**
   - The game ends when no more moves are possible
   - This happens when:
     - The board is full
     - No adjacent tiles can be merged
   - Your final score will be displayed

## Strategy Tips

1. **Corner Strategy**
   - Keep your highest value tile in a corner
   - Build a sequence of descending values from that corner

2. **Chain Reactions**
   - Plan your moves to create multiple merges in a single move
   - Think ahead to maximize your score

3. **Space Management**
   - Try to keep empty cells available for new tiles
   - Avoid scattered small numbers that can't be merged

The ultimate goal is to create a tile with the value 2048, but you can continue playing beyond this to achieve even higher scores!
